Same store sales was driven by increase\\nin prescription volumes, partially offset by reimbursement pressure and negative impact of generic introduction. \\n\\n• Operating profit in Q3 declined 5.8% due to increase in acquisition related transaction and integration costs, increase in\\noperating expenses due to investment of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in wages and benefits, as well as an\\nincrease in operating expenses associated with growth in the business. \\n\\n• CVS continue to expect full year GAAP operating profit to decline 39% to 41%, reflecting goodwill impairment in Q2. Diluted\\nEPS is expected to be at USD1.40 to USD1.50 and Adjusted EPS of USD6.98 to USD7.08. \\n\\n• CVS and Aetna have agreed with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), to divest Aetna's standalone Medicare Part D\\nprescription drug plans. Closing of the divestiture is subject to the closing of CVS's proposed acquisition of Aetna.
